This blog is being completely built with:

- `Isomorphic-dompurify`: 2.7
- `Dayjs`: 1.11.10
- `Tailwind`: 3.4.1

- `Bcrypt`: 5.1.1
- `jsonwebtoken`: 9.0.2

I used the `pnpm` as package manager.

After cloning the project, for start, install the dependencies with (run just one of the commands):
```bash
  pnpm install
```
> If you don't have the **pnpm** installed, but you have the nodejs, run `npm run install` instead.

After having all the dependencies installed, use (to start in the dev environment):
```bash
  pnpm dev
```
or (to start the production version locally):
```bash
  pnpm start
```

> Likewise, if you don't the **pnpm** installed, but have the nodejs, you can use `npm run dev` or `npm run start`.
> It is worth remembering that in order for you to be able to execute the production version, you need to "build" the project first.
> To do this run `pnpm build` or `npm run build`. After the build completed, you can then finally run the `start`

For more details about the development, there is a blog post (or there will be) explaining with more details the process.
